## üìã What You Need

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later, or a recent version of Linux.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 500 MB available.
- **Network:** Internet connection for updates and asset data.

## üíª Features

- **Dynamic Asset Allocation:** Adjust your portfolio in real time based on market conditions.
- **Market Regime Detection:** The agent identifies shifts in market behavior to optimize decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate easily, even with no programming background.
